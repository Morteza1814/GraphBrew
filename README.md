# SuperGAP Benchmarks Suite

This repository contains the GAP (Graph Algorithms in Practice) benchmarks suite, designed to compile and run various graph algorithms using C++. The Makefile in this repository automates the process of compiling these benchmarks from source code.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- **GCC**: The GNU Compiler Collection, specifically `g++` which supports C++11 or later.
- **Make**: The build utility to automate the compilation.
- **OpenMP**: Support for parallel programming in C++.

These tools are available on most Unix-like operating systems and can be installed via your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can install them using:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ make libomp-dev
```

## Enhancements

* **GraphIt-DSL:** Integration of GraphIt-DSL segment graphs to improve locality.
* **Degree-Based Grouping:** Implementing degree-based grouping strategies to test benchmark performance.
* **Graph Segmentation:**  Exploring graph segmentation techniques for efficient handling of large-scale graphs.


## GAP Benchmarks Project

This project contains a collection of Graph Analytics for Performance (GAP) benchmarks implemented in C++. The benchmarks are designed to exercise the performance of graph algorithms on a CPU. 

**Key Algorithms**

* **bc:** Breadth-First Search
* **bfs:** Breadth-First Search (alternative implementation) 
* **cc:** Connected Components
* **cc_sv:** Connected Components (single-vertex optimization)
* **pr:** PageRank
* **pr_spmv:** PageRank (using sparse matrix-vector multiplication)
* **sssp:**  Single-Source Shortest Paths
* **tc:** Triangle Counting

## Build Targets

The Makefile compiles and links the following executable targets:

* **Executable Benchmarks:** Located in the `bench/bin` directory.
* **Converter:** A utility for converting graphs into the project's input format (`bench/bin/converter`)

**Getting Started**

1. **Prerequisites**
   * A C++11 compliant compiler (e.g., g++)
   * OpenMP library for multi-threading support

2. **Building the Project**
   * Navigate to the project's root directory.
   * Run `make all` to compile the benchmarks and converter utility.

3. **Running the Benchmarks**
   * Run `make run-benchmark_name` (replace 'benchmark_name' with an algorithm name from the list above). Example: `make run-bc`  
   * The benchmark will use the following default parameters:
       * Graph ID: 10
       * Number of Runs: 1 

**Modifying the Makefile**

* **Compiler and Flags:** Edit the `CXX`, `CXXFLAGS`, and `INCLUDES` variables to customize compilation settings.
* **Benchmark Targets:** Add or remove benchmark names from the `KERNELS` variable to control which ones are built.

**Project Structure**

* `bench/src`: Contains the C++ source files for the benchmarks.
* `bench/include`: Contains header files.
* `bench/bin`: Stores the compiled executables.
* `bench/lib`: Used for intermediate build objects.

Graph Loading
-------------

All of the binaries use the same command-line options for loading graphs:
+ `-g 20` generates a Kronecker graph with 2^20 vertices (Graph500 specifications)
+ `-u 20` generates a uniform random graph with 2^20 vertices (degree 16)
+ `-f graph.el` loads graph from file graph.el
+ `-sf graph.el` symmetrizes graph loaded from file graph.el

The graph loading infrastructure understands the following formats:
+ `.el` plain-text edge-list with an edge per line as _node1_ _node2_
+ `.wel` plain-text weighted edge-list with an edge per line as _node1_ _node2_ _weight_
+ `.gr` [9th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/challenge9/download.shtml) format
+ `.graph` Metis format (used in [10th DIMACS Implementation Challenge](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/dimacs10/index.shtml))
+ `.mtx` [Matrix Market](http://math.nist.gov/MatrixMarket/formats.html) format
+ `.sg` serialized pre-built graph (use `converter` to make)
+ `.wsg` weighted serialized pre-built graph (use `converter` to make)


Executing the Benchmark
-----------------------

We provide a simple makefile-based approach to automate executing the benchmark which includes fetching and building the input graphs. Using these makefiles is not a requirement of the benchmark, but we provide them as a starting point. For example, a user could save disk space by storing the input graphs in fewer formats at the expense of longer loading and conversion times. Anything that complies with the rules in the [specification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.03619) is allowed by the benchmark.

__*Warning:*__ A full run of this benchmark can be demanding and should probably not be done on a laptop. Building the input graphs requires about 275 GB of disk space and 64 GB of RAM. Depending on your filesystem and internet bandwidth, building the graphs can take up to 8 hours. Once the input graphs are built, you can delete `gapbs/benchmark/graphs/raw` to free up some disk space. Executing the benchmark itself will require only a few hours.

Build the input graphs:
    
    $ make bench-graphs

Execute the benchmark suite:

    $ make bench-run

Spack
-----
The GAP Benchmark Suite is also included in the [Spack](https://spack.io) package manager. To install:

    $ spack install gapbs
